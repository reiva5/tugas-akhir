# Tugas Akhir IF4092
This repository dedicated to build implementation of **Personalized Keyword Search Algorithm**. Basic idea of this algorithm was founded from [this paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326307564_Personalized_Keyword_Search_on_Large_RDF_Graphs_based_on_Pattern_Graph_Similarity "Personalized Keyword Search on Large RDF Graphs Based on Pattern Graph Similarity")

## Prerequisites
1. Basic of Graph and it's algorithm in Graph Finding (*Breath First Search*, *Depth First Search*)
2. [DBPedia](https://wiki.dbpedia.org "DBPedia")
3. Python (and also it's [library](#library) detailed below)

## Library
1. RDFLib (**Required**)
2. TQDM
3. Networkx (**Required**)

## How it's works
*To be Detailed (soon)*
